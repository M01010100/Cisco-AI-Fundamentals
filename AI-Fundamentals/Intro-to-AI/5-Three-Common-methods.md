# Three Common Methods of Machine Learning
- Describe three methods by which 

## Supervised Learning 
- Providing AI with enough examples to make accurate predictions
- Need Labeled Data.
    - data is tagged with one or two labels
    - 1. What are the key characteristics: or **Features**
    - 2. What is is.
**Human Detection in Photos**

## Unsupervised Learning
- Ingests large amount of data and left to decipher the answer
- Classifies and Cluster information about the question
- Not given a Right or Wrong outcome
- good when the classification is unclear, discovers difference and similarities in the data
**Recommendation engines**

## Reinforcement Learning
- Similar to supervised but does not use training data
- uses trial and error
- rewards "right" behavior, and punishes "Wrong" behavior
    - reward as in positive reinforcement
    - negative reinforcement
- tries a prediction , then compares it with data in its corpus
    - positive Numerical Feedback
    - negative Numerical Feedback
