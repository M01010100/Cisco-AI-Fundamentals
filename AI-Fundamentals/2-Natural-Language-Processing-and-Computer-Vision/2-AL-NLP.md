# AI Performs Natural Language Processing
- Explain how AI uses NLP to derive meaning from text
- Explain the classification problem and its solutions

## NLP Tokens
- Human language is unstructured - "Messiness"
- It begins with sentence segmentation or one sentence at a time
    - Then breaks it into chucks called **Tokens** to be classified
    - once the tokens are sorted into a structure based on meaning, NLP can work

- Tokenizing can be done with categories such as **Entities** and **Relationships**
    - Entity is a noun, not adjective, verb, etc.
    - Relationships a group of two or more entities that have a strong connection
        - can be pairs of entities. I+elephant

###  After Classification
- Concepts
    - implied in a sentence but not stated 
    - matching ideas not words

## Emotion detection and Sentiment Analysis
- Emotion Detection 
    - identifies distinct human emotion types
    - anger, happiness, fear
    - significantly changed sentence concept/meaning

- Sentiment Analysis
    - Strength of emotion
    - sliding scale.

## The Classification Problem
- vague or double meaning words
    - ex run and smell
    - when a building burns down, it burns up - both down and up with one concept
    - wise guy vs wise person
