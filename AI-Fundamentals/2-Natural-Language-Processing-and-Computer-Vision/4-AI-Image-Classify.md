# AI Classifies Images
- How AI CLassifies Images to derive meaning
- How CNNs analyzes images
- How GANs creates credible images
- real-world Computer Vision

## Convolutional Neural Networks
- A standard image contains millions of pixels which themselves contain a color and brightness value; This Overwhelms most AI systems

- Devised CNNs to analyze pieces of images at a time, making it possible for visual systems
- layers between input and output, called filters

## Generative Adversarial Networks
- generates images - "deep fakes"
- Unsupervised - supervises itself
- pitting two CNNs against each other, they battle until one becomes good at creating art
- Generator 
    - fake sample
- Discriminator
    - Has real samples and determines if the fake is real or not. 
- image enhancement
- encryption
