- Machines require systems called natural language processing (NLP) to understand human language. Human language is unstructured. In NLP, machines segment sentences into small chunks of information, called a token. Machines classify and sort tokens into a structure so NLP can work with them to extract meaning.

- With IBM Project Debater, the goal was to build an AI system that could help people make evidence-based, bias-free decisions on difficult topics where the answers arenâ€™t obvious.

- The four steps a debater AI system takes include:
  - Step 1: Learn and understand the topic
  - Step 2: Build a position
  - Step 3: Organize your proof
  - Step 4: Respond to your opponent

- Emotion detection identifies distinct human emotion types. AI can be trained to classify emotions.

- Sentiment analysis is a measure of the strength of an emotion. It results in assessing if data is positive, negative, or neutral.

Chatbots are ready to answer your questions!

    The frontend interacts with the person asking questions. It listens (or reads) and speaks (or presents text).
    The backend operates application logic and has enough memory to remember earlier parts of a conversation as dialog continues.

A chatbot identifies entities and intents, then uses what it has found to trigger a dialog.

    An intent is a purpose, or the reason why a user is contacting the chatbot. Think of it as a verb or action to take.
    An entity is a person, place, or thing. Think of it as a noun.
    A dialog is a flowchart that illustrates the chatbot replies to the user intents.

-  With a convolutional neural network (CNN), an AI system can analyze images. With a generative adversarial network (GAN), an AI system can create new drawings and photos.

NLP and computer vision can be useful ways to extend human expertise.
