# How Do Machines Learn
- Distinguish between AI,ML,Deep Learning
- Describe Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning
- Structured Data
- for classifications it produces a confidence value

## Unsupervised Learning
- Unlabeled data, such as a text 
- explores data to determine structure

## Reinforcement
- Information is non-specific, learns through trial and error
- it classifies the data and gives itself a confidence value
