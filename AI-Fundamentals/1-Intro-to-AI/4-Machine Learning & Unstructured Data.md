# Is Machine Learning the Answer to the unstructured data problem. 
- Define and describe Machine Learning
- How Machine Learning structures unstructured data
- How MAchine Learning uses probabilistic calculations to solve problems

## Solving Dark Data Problems 
- ML can analyze UnStrc data faster then programmable
**Example: traffic routing through a city**
- Programmable Computer
    - upload a complete database of all routes through city
    - add extensive data about current weather, and traffic conditions
    - Search through all data to find routes
    - requires extensive time and computation to complete
- Machine Learning
    - use a tree like methodology with its root as the starting location.
    - Then branched out in all different route to end location 
    - repeats until it discovers optimal route
    - does not need a database of all routes, responds to traffic quickly as it dose not rely on complete alternative routes
- advantages of ML
    - ML can predict
    - ML learns

## Probabilistic Calculations
- Other ways to contrast classical and ML systems
    - Deterministic and Probabilistic

- Deterministic
    - large, predetermined structure of routes
    - then flags a route as yes or no
    - True or False
- Probabilistic
    - Never uses Yes or No, ML can be viewed as analog with gradual change in waves unlike the digital Deterministic
    - constructs all routes and compares them while including variables such as weather and traffic. 

- Who decides in a probabilistic system
    - Depends on situation, either human final say or machine. 
- From medicine, education, social studies, and government the best decision making is a combination of Human and Machine strength
    - **Common Sense**
