## ML Models 
ML is making predictions using statistics and calculus, both of which are pieces of code used in ML **Algorithms**. Which are organized into **Models**. 

- Algorithm
    - set of program code : a Function
    - designed to do X, analyze patterns in data

- Models
    - Group of algorithms
    - operating together, they analyze the output and make predictions

- **A ML model can reprogram itself**

## Watson studio
- single environment for sharing work to solve problems
