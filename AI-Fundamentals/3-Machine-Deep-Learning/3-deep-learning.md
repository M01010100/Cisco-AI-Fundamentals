# The Deep Learning Ecosystem
- how Neural Nets are inspired by the brain
- flow of information through a perceptron's nodes
- ML Trial and errors
- deep learning and ecosystems

## Inspired by the brain
- Deep Learning Ecosystem
- Neural Networks are the foundation
- A perceptron acts a single Neuron
    - has an input layer
    - one/more hidden layers
    - Output Layer
- A Node often uses a sigmoid to determine to "fire" or not

## A Path through a Neural Network
- Calculating not Thinking
- adds weight 

## Machine Learning is often trial and error
- Stores data in a corpus
- constantly testing new data with its calculations to the corpus
- Makes many guesses
    - Begins at random, then adjusts based on it position with new and old data
    - keeps guessing and using "right-size" adjustments to continue
    - nears perfection but never reaches it
- A Perception requires more Brainpower in the form of deep learning

## From Perception to deep learning
- Deep Neural Network - Multiple Hidden Layers
    - Identify locations and people in photos
    - housing prices
    - Self Driving cars
    - Variations in MRI
