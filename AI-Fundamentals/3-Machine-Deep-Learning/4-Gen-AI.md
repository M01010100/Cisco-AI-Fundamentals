## What is Gen AI
- Creates new, original content based on prompts
    - Most AI are discriminative, predict and classify data
    
## How does Gen AI work
- virtual artist
1. Person feeds the AI a large amount of data. 
2. AI analyzes the data, patterns and relationships, and use them to generate similar but not identical examples
3. Generates new outputs by the input of a random seed value.
    - The seed value is a random starting point

### Types
- Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
    - views data, creates a sketch of it, then creates new data from the sketch
    - captures the essential elements and creating a new with it
    - The "encoder" compresses the input data to a lower dimensional representation
    - decoder reconstructs the original data
- Generative Adversarial Network
    - teo networks, generator and discriminator. 
- Autoregressive 
    - skilled story teller, given a beginning, it can continue and finish the story
    - predict next element in a sequence
    - text generation

## Examples
- ChatGPT
    - interacts with conversational natural language
    - takes prompts and generates response
- Watson
    - LLMs, to obtain insights
    - Used heavily in Research
- DALL-E DALL-E 2
    - Natural Text input to generate images

## Industry 
- Sports
    - Computer vision system to analyze players and identify areas for improvement

- Entertainment
    - Amper Music to generate original music
    - input parameters such as mood, genre, and tempo

- Healthcare
    - PathAI, deep learning algorithm to detect cancer cells in digital pathology images
    - trained on annotated pathology images using a VAE which learned the underlying structure of images. 

- Business
    - Syntiant uses Gen AI to develop low power, deep learning chips for a range of industries.
    - GAN to create synthetic data by generating new data samples. 

## Limitations 
- Lack of originality
- Incompleteness
- Bias
- Computation

### Ethics
- Misinformation
- IP & Copyright 
- Privacy
- Loss of human touch
- unemployment
