# Classical Machine Learning
- Decision Trees, Linear Regression, & Logistic Regression
- advantages of Classical Learning
- sigmoid function

## Classical 
- pattern recognition 
- Decision Tree
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression

## Decision Tree 
- Supervised Learning Algorithm
    - upside down flowchart
    - root node  that connects to branch nodes, then leaf nodes

## Linear Regression
- relates data that can represent a straight line
- ex more spending = more sales

## Logistic Regression
- when a No,Yes outcome is needed, such as using a sigmoid function
    - ex: comparing hours studied to passing 

- difference
    - Linear : If this increases by X, How much will Y increase
    - Logistic : If this increases by X, will the value of Y be closer t 0 or 1

## Classical is not obsolete
- Structured Data
- less Computing power
- results are clear
