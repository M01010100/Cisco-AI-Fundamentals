# Three eras of computing
- history of AI

## Era 1: Tabulation (~ - 1900s)
- slicing data to give it structure

- Dark Data 
    - Unstructured Data, mess of info and facts
- Structuring Data 
    - abacus
    - difference engine - Babbage & Lovelace (mid 1800s)

## Era 2: Programming (1940-)
- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC)
    - Artillery firing tables
    - feasibility of thermonuclear weapons

## Era 3: AI ()
- 1940s - Turing Machines
- 1950 - Turing Test
- 1951 Minsky Neural Net
- 1958 - Dartmouth Conference on AI - John McCarthy
- 1966 ELIZA
- 1970-80 - 1st AI Winter, high expectations and reduced funding
    - best computers running NLP could only hold around 20 words
    - unable to build a dataset beyond the int of a 2 year old
- 1982
    - Expert Systems - ZX81
    - Hopfield back propagation
- 1982-1993 Unmet expectations and lack of computing power
- 1997 Deep blue beats Garry Kasparov in chess
- 2011 Watson wins Jeopardy 
- 2016 Deep Neural Network powered AlphaGo beets world go champion
