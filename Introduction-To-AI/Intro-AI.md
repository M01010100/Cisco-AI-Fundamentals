# Intro to AI - IBM Skill Share

## Objectives: 
 - Define Artificial Intelligence
 - Differentiate AI and Augmented Int
 - three levels of AI

## AI
- ability for machine to learn patterns and make predictions
- enhances human judgement

**Reflection:**

AI can be a tool to enhance human productivity and judgement. It can aid a human in deciding what actions to take by predicting outcomes of their decision.  


## Three Intelligences

- Human
    - operate a vehicle
- Artificial
    - ability for machines to perform "Human" intelligent actions.
    - self driving/ autopilot
- Augmented
    - using machines to enhance human abilities and vice-versa 
    - Driving assists

| Machine | Human |
|:--------|:------|
|ingest data | Generalizing |  
|Repetitive | Creativity |
| *Accurate | emotion |

### AI Calculates not thinks

- AI
  - program to recognize what label and route to correctly identify objects

- Machine Learning 
    - give the machine more data and train it on the characteristics of each type of objects; size, shape, color, etc. 
    - improve more outputs with more data ans tune parameters. Minimizes errors by repetitive guessing. 
- Deep Learning
    - eliminates need of feature extraction; built into it
    - Multi-layer Neural Networks take in data and learn implicit representation

- Analysis
    - AI applies Mathematical calculations in order to analyze data, sorting and organizing it.

- Prediction
    - AI services use their analysis to make predictions.

## What predictions can AI make
- for spell check it predictions what word you typed based or dictionaries and phrases to guess what your trying to type 

- Human Language 
    - A chatbot uses NLP or Natural Language Processing to analyze a given text and predict based on topics
- Vision Recognition 
    - based on early warning signs and symptoms ot determine sickness
    - read speed traffic signs as it guides cars through traffic
- Fraud Detection
    - analyzes patterns for standard purchases and behavior and predicts which may be the result of fraud

## AI evolving

- Narrow (2010-2015) 
    - Addressing single task such as predicting next purchase
    - Scaled quickly in consumer environments where there are lots of data; buying a book with a voice-based device
    - Siri, autonomous vehicles, amazon recommends
- Broad (Today)
    - More versatile and can be integrated for business processes. train-able on enterprise/business data to perform those processes. 
    - global weather, trace pandemics, predict future market trends. 
- General AI (Future)
    - perform any task human intelligence can
    - abstract thought and primarily theory based.
